Applying the level set method, discretized scheme is obtained for each material separated by material interface, and small cut cells are merged into neighboring cells. To get accurate interface exchanges for reactive ﬂuids, the Riemann problem with a combustion wave is analyzed. One- and two-dimensional numerical examples for deﬂagration and detonation problems demonstrate the scheme is robust and effective.},

In this numerical experiment, a set of Riemann initial values is designed, such that only detonation can occur under the classical Chapmanqouguet (CJ) theory. Based on the set of Riemann initial values, a family of solutions is computed corresponding to different values of reaction rate k and viscosity v. Furthermore, the structure of the limit solution, as k {\textasciitilde} +{\textasciitilde}c, v {\textasciitilde} 0, is studied. Our results show that the structure of the limit solution depends on the parameter C = kv. The strong, CJ detonation and weak detonation waves are all possible to appear. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We analyze the Riemann problem for reacting gas flow, under conditions where detonations and deflagrations can occur. We show that for a given deflagration velocity law, a Riemann solution which involves a deflagration may fail to exist but a Riemann solution involving a detonation may exist instead. We use our results to study an idealized model of transition from deflagration to detonation, using the Glimm (random choice) method. Numerical and asymptotic results are given, which compare well with certain experimental data. The broader usefulness of the results is indicated. One of the most interesting features of our model is the indication it provides that no transition occurs if the flame is laminar, and thus in particular, if the flow is purely one-dimensional.},

  abstract  = {In this work we analyze the reactive Riemann problem for thermally perfect gases in the deﬂagration or detonation regimes. We restrict our attention to the case of one irreversible inﬁnitely fast chemical reaction; we also suppose that, in the initial condition, one state (for instance the left one) is burnt and the other one is unburnt. The indeterminacy of the deﬂagration regime is removed by imposing a (constant) value for the fundamental ﬂame speed of the reactive shock. An iterative algorithm is proposed for the solution of the reactive Riemann problem. Then the reactive Riemann problem and the proposed algorithm are investigated from a numerical point of view in the case in which the unburnt state consists of a stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and air at almost atmospheric condition. In particular, we revisit the problem of 1D plane-symmetric steady ﬂames in a semi-inﬁnite domain and we verify that the transition from one combustion regime to another occurs continuously with respect to the fundamental ﬂame speed and the so-called piston velocity. Finally, we use the ‘all shock’ solution of the reactive Riemann problem to design an approximate (‘all shock’) Riemann solver. 1D and 2D ﬂows at different combustion regimes are computed, which shows that the approximate Riemann solver, and thus the algorithm we use for the solution of the reactive Riemann problem, is robust in both the deﬂagration and detonation regimes.
