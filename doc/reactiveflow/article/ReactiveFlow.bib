	abstract = {In this paper, we present a conservative sharp interface numerical method for compressible reactive ﬂows. This method is developed by modiﬁed ﬁnite volume scheme in Eulerian framework. Applying the level set method, discretized scheme is obtained for each material separated by material interface, and small cut cells are merged into neighboring cells. To get accurate interface exchanges for reactive ﬂuids, the Riemann problem with a combustion wave is analyzed. One- and two-dimensional numerical examples for deﬂagration and detonation problems demonstrate the scheme is robust and effective.},

	abstract = {The effects of viscosity v and reaction rate k on the Riemann solutions of NavierStokes equations for a reacting gas are analyzed numerically. In this numerical experiment, a set of Riemann initial values is designed, such that only detonation can occur under the classical Chapmanqouguet (CJ) theory. Based on the set of Riemann initial values, a family of solutions is computed corresponding to different values of reaction rate k and viscosity v. Furthermore, the structure of the limit solution, as k {\textasciitilde} +{\textasciitilde}c, v {\textasciitilde} 0, is studied. Our results show that the structure of the limit solution depends on the parameter C = kv. The strong, CJ detonation and weak detonation waves are all possible to appear. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We analyze the Riemann problem for reacting gas flow, under conditions where detonations and deflagrations can occur. We show that for a given deflagration velocity law, a Riemann solution which involves a deflagration may fail to exist but a Riemann solution involving a detonation may exist instead. We use our results to study an idealized model of transition from deflagration to detonation, using the Glimm (random choice) method. Numerical and asymptotic results are given, which compare well with certain experimental data. The broader usefulness of the results is indicated. One of the most interesting features of our model is the indication it provides that no transition occurs if the flame is laminar, and thus in particular, if the flow is purely one-dimensional.},
